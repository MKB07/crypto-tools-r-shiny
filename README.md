# crypto-tools-r-shiny
This is a collection of encryption tools developed in R with the Shiny framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for secure text and document file encryption and decryption. The main highlight of these tools is their unique key generation process, which draws inspiration from the genetic code. 
Users are required to remember their own unique codon or codon+atom combination, which allows for an extensive number of possibilities while maintaining a straightforward user experience. The codon or codon+atom acts as the encryption key, ensuring a high level of security.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text or the content of document files using AES encryption.
- Key generation based on a mapping matrix with 64 or 10,000 possibilities.
- Simple user interface with the requirement to remember a unique codon or codon+atom combination.
- Supports various encryption methods, including AES with matrix-based key generation and Caesar cipher with a password phrase.


**Please note that tools are an ongoing project, and enhancements and new features are being continuously developed. Your contributions and feedback are highly appreciated as we strive to improve the security and usability of the tools.**
